# satnogs-ml-vetting

Project from the [NASA SpaceAppsChallenge Berlin](https://spaceappberlin.eu/) challenge. 

Aims to detect if recieved radio transmissions from the [SatNOGs](https://network.satnogs.org) project, which were recorded during a satellite flyover, really contain radio data from the satellite ("vetting").
